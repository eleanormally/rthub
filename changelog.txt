created client and server:
  actual sending of the key isn't working yet, get that to work.

functional authentication + sending
  can now verify someone should be allowed to get Data
  easy to send data between client and server
  still need to do updating so that the ips are refreshed
  need to send ip to server for storage
  need to send traits about client
  need to constant stream back

completed server connection & information transfer:
  remove key= & other headers so that data is just represented by an order and separated by a marker
  added client ip, client network, client name, and client status to upload
  added response and update from server to client
  made parsing work more dynamically so that new data points can be added easily
  renamed ReferenceLink class to GroupHost class to better reflect function
  stopped server from breaking every time you connect
  added batch files to get default gateway
  added Client class serverside to store client list & added User class clientside (same code)
